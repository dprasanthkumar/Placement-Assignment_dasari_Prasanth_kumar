To conduct a t-test and determine if there is a significant difference in the mean improvement scores between the two groups (Group A and Group B), we can follow these steps:

Step 1: State the null hypothesis (H0) and alternative hypothesis (H1):
- Null hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in the mean improvement scores between Group A and Group B.
- Alternative hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in the mean improvement scores between Group A and Group B.

Step 2: Choose the appropriate t-test:
Since we are comparing the means of two independent groups, we will use an independent samples t-test.

Step 3: Set the significance level (alpha):
The significance level (alpha) is given as 0.05, which means we want a 95% confidence level for our test.

Step 4: Calculate the test statistic:
We can calculate the t-test statistic using the formula:

t = (mean1 - mean2) / sqrt((s1^2 / n1) + (s2^2 / n2))

Where:
mean1 = mean improvement score for Group A
mean2 = mean improvement score for Group B
s1 = standard deviation of improvement for Group A
s2 = standard deviation of improvement for Group B
n1 = number of patients in Group A
n2 = number of patients in Group B

Plugging in the values, we get:
t = (2.5 - 2.2) / sqrt((0.8^2 / 30) + (0.6^2 / 30))

Step 5: Determine the degrees of freedom:
The degrees of freedom for an independent samples t-test is calculated as (n1 + n2 - 2).

Plugging in the values, we get:
Degrees of freedom = (30 + 30 - 2) = 58

Step 6: Find the critical value:
Since the significance level is 0.05, and we have a two-tailed test, we need to find the critical t-value for a significance level of 0.025 (0.05 divided by 2) with 58 degrees of freedom. Using a t-table or a statistical software, the critical t-value is approximately 2.001.

Step 7: Compare the test statistic with the critical value:
If the absolute value of the test statistic is greater than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis; otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

Let's calculate the test statistic and compare it with the critical value:

t = (2.5 - 2.2) / sqrt((0.8^2 / 30) + (0.6^2 / 30))
  ≈ 0.3 / sqrt(0.02133 + 0.012)
  ≈ 0.3 / sqrt(0.03333)
  ≈ 0.3 / 0.18257
  ≈ 1.643

The absolute value of the test statistic (1.643) is less than the critical value (2.001). Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

b. Based on the t-test results, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is no significant difference in the mean improvement scores between Group A and Group B. In the context of the study, it implies that the new drug does not show a statistically significant advantage over the standard drug in terms of the improvement in the specific symptom after the 4-week treatment period.
