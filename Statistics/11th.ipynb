The null hypothesis (H0) is that the means of all classes are equal.\n",

    "c. Which amount LDA and QDA would perform better on this data for classification and why.\n",
    "To determine which classification method would perform better on this data, we need to assess the underlying distributions and variances of the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA assumes that the classes have a common covariance matrix and that the predictor variables are normally distributed. It aims to find a linear combination of the predictors that maximally separates the classes. LDA performs well when the assumption of a common covariance matrix holds and the classes have distinct means but similar variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "QDA relaxes the assumption of a common covariance matrix and allows each class to have its own covariance matrix. It also assumes that the predictor variables are normally distributed. QDA is more flexible and can capture more complex relationships between the predictors and the classes. It may perform better when the classes have different variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine which method would be more suitable, we can calculate the covariance matrices for each class and assess their similarity. If the covariance matrices are similar, LDA may be more appropriate. If the covariance matrices differ significantly, indicating different variances between classes, QDA might be more suitable.\n"
