    "The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. In this case, the correlation coefficient between SAT scores and college GPA is 0.7.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation coefficient is represented by the symbol \"r\" and ranges from -1 to +1. A positive value of r indicates a positive relationship, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable also tends to increase. A negative value of r indicates a negative relationship, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease. The magnitude of the correlation coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, a correlation coefficient of 0.7 indicates a strong positive relationship between SAT scores and college GPA. This means that as SAT scores increase, there is a tendency for college GPA to also increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for calculating the correlation coefficient is:\n",
    "\n",
    "r = (Σ((X - X̄) * (Y - Ȳ))) / sqrt(Σ((X - X̄)^2) * Σ((Y - Ȳ)^2))\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- X and Y are the respective values of the two variables (SAT scores and college GPA in this case)\n",
    "- X̄ and Ȳ are the means of X and Y, respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "In this formula, the numerator calculates the sum of the product of the differences between each pair of X and Y values and their respective means. The denominator calculates the square root of the product of the sum of the squared differences of X from its mean and the sum of the squared differences of Y from its mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "By calculating this formula using the given data, you can determine the correlation coefficient. In this case, the resulting value is 0.7, indicating a strong positive relationship between SAT scores and college GPA.\n",
