a. To find the percentage of individuals with heights between 160 cm and 180 cm, we need to calculate the z-scores for these heights and then find the area under the normal distribution curve between these z-scores.

First, we calculate the z-score for 160 cm:
z1 = (160 - mean) / standard deviation = (160 - 170) / 10 = -1

Next, we calculate the z-score for 180 cm:
z2 = (180 - mean) / standard deviation = (180 - 170) / 10 = 1

Using a standard normal distribution table or a statistical software, we can find the area under the curve between -1 and 1. This represents the percentage of individuals with heights between 160 cm and 180 cm.

b. When randomly selecting a sample of 100 individuals, the distribution of sample means will follow a normal distribution with the same mean as the population (170 cm) but with a smaller standard deviation known as the standard error of the mean. 

The standard error of the mean (SE) can be calculated as:
SE = standard deviation / sqrt(sample size)
SE = 10 / sqrt(100) = 10 / 10 = 1

To find the probability that the average height of the sample is greater than 175 cm, we need to calculate the z-score for 175 cm using the standard error of the mean.

z = (sample mean - population mean) / SE = (175 - 170) / 1 = 5

We can then use a standard normal distribution table or a statistical software to find the probability corresponding to a z-score of 5 or greater.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
c. To find the z-score corresponding to a height of 185 cm, we use the formula:

z = (x - mean) / standard deviation = (185 - 170) / 10 = 15 / 10 = 1.5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
d. To find the approximate height corresponding to the threshold where 5% of the dataset has heights below that value, we need to find the z-score that corresponds to the 5th percentile (or 0.05 probability) of the normal distribution.

Using a standard normal distribution table or a statistical software, we can find the z-score corresponding to the 5th percentile. Let's denote it as z_threshold.

Then, we can calculate the height corresponding to the threshold as:

threshold height = (z_threshold * standard deviation) + mean
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
e. The coefficient of variation (CV) is a measure of relative variability and is calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, expressed as a percentage:

CV = (standard deviation / mean) * 100
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
f. Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of a distribution. If the skewness is approximately zero, it indicates that the distribution is roughly symmetric.

Skewness can be calculated using the formula:

skewness = (3 * (mean - median)) / standard deviation

where mean is the mean of the dataset, median is the median of the dataset, and standard deviation is the standard deviation of the dataset.

Interpreting the result depends on the actual value of the skewness. A skewness of zero suggests that the dataset is symmetric, meaning the data is evenly distributed on both sides of the mean.
